This repository *used* to be the Kudu-ready deployment for nodatime.org

We're now using Google Cloud Build to do the Docker build, followed by a push to GKE, so we don't need this repo any more.

We may want it again in the future, so I haven't deleted it - but the content would get stale very quickly.
