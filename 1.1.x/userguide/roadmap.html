    <h1>Current roadmap</h1>
    <p>The following is an <em>approximate</em> roadmap for the major features that
we hope to support in Noda Time.  Some of this roadmap is inspired by
Noda Time's <a href="limitations.html">current limitations</a>.</p>

<p>If there's something not mentioned here that you feel should be on this
roadmap, then <em>please</em> either raise an issue or post on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/noda-time">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>This roadmap was last updated on <strong>2013-03-04</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>1.2
<ul>
<li>Better serialization: add native support for XML serialization,
complete the Json.NET serialization (and release as a package)</li>
<li>Better parsing/formatting: custom parsing and formatting for
<code>ZonedDateTime</code> and <code>OffsetDateTime</code>; <em>possibly</em> likewise for
<code>Period</code>, and more consistency around access to standard
patterns</li>
<li>Revisit <code>NodaFormatInfo</code></li>
<li>Refactor calendar engine</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1.3
<ul>
<li>Provide more information from CLDR for time zone information
(e.g. sample cities to display to users)</li>
<li>Possibly, use CLDR for other l10n resources</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Features currently scheduled for removal or breaking change in 2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>all obsolete API members</li>
<li>support for the legacy resource-based time zone data format</li>
<li>revisit all ordering and equality comparison operations, quite possibly
 rewriting them to be calendar-insensitive</li>
</ul>
