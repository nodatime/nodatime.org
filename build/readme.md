This directory contains tools and scripts related to building
Noda Time; no code within this directory is actually shipped as part
of a downloadable package. For the sake of convenience, we've
therefore used simple names for the tools here, rather than having a
NodaTime prefix for everything.

The files here are primarily of interest to the Noda Time developers
rather than users, and even then most of them are really around
release management.

Basically, if you don't *know* you're interested in files here,
you're probably not. Code within this directory is unlikely to be
pretty, and is primarily tested by trial and error...
