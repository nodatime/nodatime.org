@Title="Current roadmap"

The following is an _approximate_ roadmap for the major features that
we hope to support in Noda Time.  Some of this roadmap is inspired by
Noda Time's [current limitations][].

[current limitations]: http://nodatime.org/userguide/limitations.html

If there's something not mentioned here that you feel should be on this
roadmap, then *please* either raise an issue or post on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/noda-time).

This roadmap was last updated on **2014-06-27**.

**2.0**

- Remove all obsolete API members
- Remove support for the legacy resource-based time zone data format
- Make all public static fields properties
- Revisit all ordering and equality comparison operations. (Many may be removed, others may
  be exposed via specific comparers.)
- Change granularity to be nanoseconds
- Change internal representations (almost entirely hidden from the API, but will have
  performance impact - probably in both directions)
- Introduce "adjusters" - functions such as "end of month", "next Wednesday",
  "truncate to second" which can be expressed in a unified API. Similar specific methods
  in the API may be removed.
- Fix handling of all extreme values, with well-understood limits, no "beginning of time"
  values, etc.
- Introduce new extension methods in Testing assembly, and make some existing methods
  extension methods. (We're pretty sure we don't need to support .NET 2.0, ever...)
- Rename some methods which map cleanly to those in the BCL.
- Consider adding a time zone to a clock, making it easier to express "now in the local time 
  zone" in one go.

**Unscheduled features and issues which we hope to address at some point**

- Support month name parsing/formatting for the Hebrew calendar using `CultureInfo`
- Ethopian calendars
- More code analysis using Roslyn (e.g. check that all non-nullable parameters are validated)

**Separate CLDR project**

- Formatting (probably not parsing) using CLDR data for month names, Unicode pattern symbols, possibly non-ASCII numbers.
- CLDR time zone information (e.g. sample cities to display to users)
