@Title="Recipes"

New users can sometimes be a little overwhelmed by Noda Time, and want examples. This
page collects a lot of them in one place. A lot of these are small, because once you
know what operation you're trying to achieve, Noda Time makes it very easy to express
that... but it can still be tricky finding that if you're new to the API.

These examples typically use explicitly-typed local variables so that you can tell
all the types involved easily. You can use implicitly-typed local variables (`var`)
in your own code, of course.

To run any recipe immediately, just hit the "Copy to editor" button and then the "Run" button.
You can then modify the code - including using Intellisense to explore the API, by pressing Ctrl-Space -
and rerun it to see the results.

How old is Jon?
====

Jon was born on June 19th, 1976 (Gregorian). How old is he now, in the UK time zone?

```csharp-trydotnet
LocalDate birthDate = new LocalDate(1976, 6, 19);
DateTimeZone zone = DateTimeZoneProviders.Tzdb["Europe/London"];
ZonedClock clock = SystemClock.Instance.InZone(zone);
LocalDate today = clock.GetCurrentDate();
Console.WriteLine($"Today's date: {today:yyyy-MM-dd}");
Period age = Period.Between(birthDate, today);
Console.WriteLine(
    $"Jon is: {age.Years} years, {age.Months} months, {age.Days} days old.");
```

Note that a `using` directive for `NodaTime.Extensions` is required for this,
as `InZone` is an extension method in `NodaTime.Extensions.ClockExtensions`.

(Also note that running this recipe in Try .NET may show an old date, if the
result is cached from a previous run. We're working on it!)

How can I get to the start or end of a month?
====

Use the [`DateAdjusters`](noda-type://NodaTime.DateAdjusters) factory class to obtain a suitable adjuster, and then either apply it
directly (it's just a `Func<LocalDate, LocalDate>`) or use the `With` method to apply it in a fluent
style:

```csharp-trydotnet
LocalDate today = new LocalDate(2014, 6, 27);
LocalDate endOfMonth = today.With(DateAdjusters.EndOfMonth);
Console.WriteLine(endOfMonth); // 2014-06-30
```

Date adjusters also work with `LocalDateTime` and `OffsetDateTime` values. For example:

```csharp-trydotnet
LocalDateTime now = new LocalDate(2014, 6, 27, 7, 14, 25);
LocalDateTime startOfMonth = now.With(DateAdjusters.StartOfMonth);
Console.WriteLine(startOfMonth); // 2014-06-01T07:14:25
```

How can I truncate a time to a particular unit?
====

Use the [`TimeAdjusters`](noda-type://NodaTime.TimeAdjusters) factory class to obtain a suitable adjuster, which can be applied to a
`LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime` or `OffsetDateTime`:

```csharp-trydotnet
LocalDateTime now = new LocalDate(2014, 6, 27, 7, 14, 25, 500);
LocalDateTime now = now.With(TimeAdjusters.TruncateToMinute); // 2014-06-27T07:14:00
```
