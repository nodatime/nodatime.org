@Title="Patterns for Duration values"

The [`Duration`](noda-type://NodaTime.Duration) type supports the following patterns:

Standard Patterns
-----------------

The following standard pattern is supported:

- `o`: Round-trip pattern, which always uses the invariant culture and a pattern string of `-D:hh:mm:ss.FFFFFFFFF`.
  This is the default format pattern.

Custom Patterns
---------------

The following custom pattern characters are supported for durations. See [custom pattern notes](text.html#custom-patterns)
for general notes on custom patterns, including characters used for escaping and text literals.

The pattern letters basically split into two categories:
- "Total" values, which represent as much of the duration as possible. For example, 1 day and 2 hours has a "total hours" value of 26. 
- "Partial" values, which represent part of a duration within a larger unit. For example, 1 day and 2 hours has an "hours of day" value of 2.

A pattern can only have a single "total" value, and typically will have exactly one total value, which would be the largest unit represented. You would normally want to then use each successive "partial" unit until you've got to the precision you're interested in. For example, useful patterns are:

- `-D:hh:mm:ss` - days, hours, minutes and seconds
- `-H:mm:ss.fff` - hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds
- `M:ss` - just minutes and seconds (not terribly useful for very long durations, or negative ones)  

Bad (but legal) patterns would be:

- `hh:MM:ss` - total minutes, but only partial hours!
- `HH:ss` - total hours, partial seconds... but no partial minutes

It's possible that a future release will be detect "bad" patterns and reject them more aggressively.

Every total letter can be repeated up to 10 times, indicating the level of zero-padding applied.
Total letter values are parsed for up to 10 digits.
Partial letters for hours, minutes and seconds can be repeated once or twice
(so 'h' and 'hh' are valid, but 'hhh' is not); again, this is for zero-padding, so a value of 3 hours
and 2 minutes formatted with 'H:m' would simply be "3:2", whereas formatted with 'H:mm' it would be "3:02".
We recommend using the repeated form in most cases.

	    This is <em>always</em> a period ("."); not a culture-sensitive decimal separator as one might expect. This
		follows the example of other standard libraries, however odd it may appear. The only difference
		between a period and any other literal character is that when followed by a series of "F" characters,
		the period will be removed if there are no fractional seconds.
