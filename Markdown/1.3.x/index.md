@Title="Overview"

This guide provides documentation to complement the API reference.
It is recommended that you read at least the first few pages before
starting to develop using Noda Time. If you have suggestions or
questions which are likely to be discussion-based, please post to
the [mailing list][group]. For more specific "How do I solve problem X?"
questions, please ask on [Stack Overflow][so] using the [nodatime tag][so-tag].
