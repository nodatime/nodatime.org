This file (and directory) exists to allow developers to clone the
nodatime.org repo and run the web site immediately. The web site
expects the API documentation (generated by docfx) to be in this
directory.

Having an empty directory is useful for getting started quickly, but if
you want to actually see the API documentation, you need to run
`buildweb.sh` from the `build` directory. That will populate this
directory.

This directory is deliberately specified in `.gitignore` so that
local changes to it are not propagated to source control.
